*localview.txt* Plugin for storing and loading views from local files

Vim-views are essentially just vim scripts that re-establish the current
view of a file, including (among other things), the scroll position, the
folds, current directory, and mappings. Vim has built in functionality to
save and restore up to ten different views for each file using the |:mkview|
and |:loadview| commands. However, these files are generally stored in an
installation dependent location. The purpose of this plugin is to make it
easy (and automatic) to save these views in the same directory as the file
itself, thereby making them much more easily portable. 

							*localview:overview*
OVERVIEW

Local view stores "settings" (not Vim settings, just the generic sense of the
word) for each open buffer in buffer-local variables. There are two such
settings: whether or not local views are enabled, and the file to use to store
local views. 

When local views are enabled for a buffer, the current view is saved to the
appropriate file everytime the file is saved. By default, the view
file is a file in the same directory (hence "local") which has the same name
as the file in the buffer, but starts with a dot (so it will generally be a
hidden file on most systems), and ends with ".lv.vim" (i.e., local-view.vim).
For example >
	foo.bar
<
has a default local-view file of >
	.foo.bar.lv.vim
<

The other thing this plugin it does is to try to load a local-view when new
buffers are opened. It does this by looking for an appropriately named file
that it is able to read. If it finds one, then it enables local-views for this
buffer, and loads the file it found. As a convenience, if the default file
described above is not found, it will also check for a similarly named file,
but without the leading dot. This allows you to more easily use non-hidden
local-view files, which may be helpful if, for instance, you want to copy the
view files from location to location (which is, after all, the primary
motivation behind this plugin). You can also easily switch to using this
alternate local-view file with the |:Uselocalviewalt| command.

COMMANDS

This plugin adds the following commands, if not already defined. 

					*:Enablelocalview*
					*:Enlocalview*
					*:Enlv*
					*:Enlocview*
:Enlocalview
:Enlocview
:Enlv
:Enablelocalview	Enables local views for the current buffer. This means
			that everytime the buffer is written, it's view will
			be saved to the appropriate file.
